unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver took a Euro ##s 35 ##3 ##m ( Pound ##s 244 ##m ) write ##- ##down in Slim ##- ##F ##ast after sales of its products fell 25 per cent in the first half .
unused ##1 The Slim ##- ##F ##ast write ##- ##down hurt Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s operating profits , which fell 18 per cent in the quarter .
unused ##1 The rise in overall sales volume was driven by strong demand for Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s products , including O ##mo laundry de ##ter ##gent and Pond ' ##s cream , in Asia and Africa .
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s performance in Europe remains weak due to pricing pressure from hard discount ##ers and competition among manufacturers , and underlying European sales fell 0 ##. ##6 per cent in the second quarter .

unused ##1 Western Europe remains a difficult market for Un ##ile ##ver , with sales volumes dropping 3 ##. ##7 per cent in the quarter as consumers switched to cheaper own ##- ##la ##bel products .
unused ##1 Paul Pol ##man , Un ##ile ##ver chief executive , warned of a " pro ##tracted " global economic recovery and price def ##lation as the maker of Li ##pton tea and Suns ##il ##k s ##ham ##po ##o reported strong third ##- ##qua ##rter results .

unused ##1 The company attributed the healthy sales growth to a strong performance in em ##er ##g ##- ing markets , which account for 44 per cent of total sales .
unused ##1 It stressed that all product categories , with the exception of ice cream , were showing sales and profit growth .

unused ##1 Growth of the brands has , however , la ##gged behind those in emerging markets , where sales have risen 6 to 8 per cent during the past three years .
unused ##1 Inc ##reased marketing investment in ice ##- ##cre ##am , s ##ham ##po ##os and de ##od ##oran ##ts led to higher third ##- ##qua ##rter sales at Un ##ile ##ver , whose underlying revenue growth of 4 ##. ##8 per cent surpassed expectations .

unused ##1 The Sara Lee business is worth EU ##R ##75 ##0 ##m in sales , and has earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation of EU ##R ##12 ##8 ##m , making the value of the deal a reasonable 10 times e ##bit ##da .

unused ##1 With sales of the local brands in decline , and Un ##ile ##ver holding the number three position in the ma ##rga ##rine market , the company decided the best option for the local brands was to sell them .
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver is today expected to announce a four ##- ##ye ##ar agreement to buy Pound ##s 200 ##m worth of air ##time with ITV , b ##ucking the trend of declining advertising revenues at the broadcaster .
unused ##1 S ##hare ##holders in ITV have been concerned about an expected 14 per cent fall in advertising on ITV ##1 , its core mass ##- ##market channel , in the first quarter of the year ##and are expecting guidance about whether ITV sees this as a seasonal an ##oma ##ly or a pattern for the full year .

unused ##1 The broadcaster is expected to deliver a strong increase in pre ##- ##ta ##x profit for 2005 , up from Pound ##s 255 ##m to Pound ##s 435 ##m as favourable regulatory judgement ##s are expected to out ##wei ##gh the impact of declining advertising revenues .
unused ##1 Turn ##over is forecast to increase from Pound ##s 2 ##. ##0 ##8 ##b ##n to Pound ##s 2 ##. ##16 ##b ##n and earnings per share should rise from 5 ##. ##32 ##p to about 7 ##. ##5 ##p ##.

unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver looks to clean up in Alberto C ##ul ##ver buy
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s s ##wo ##op on Alberto C ##ul ##ver was predominantly greeted with enthusiasm by analysts and investors , with most seeing it as a s ##hr ##ew ##d move into the fastest ##- ##gro ##wing sector of the consumer goods industry .
unused ##1 As ##suming earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation for 2010 of $ ##25 ##9 ##m ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##16 ##3 ##m ) and the small amount of cash held by Alberto C ##ul ##ver , the $ ##3 ##. ##7 ##b ##n price tag will mean an enterprise value to e ##bit ##da multiple of 14 times .
unused ##1 It compares favour ##ably with the most recent acquisition in personal care products , that of Re ##cki ##tt Ben ##cki ##ser taking over SS ##L International , the maker of Du ##re ##x condom ##s and Sc ##hol ##l foot ##care , in July this year for pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##5 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 The group ' ##s operating margins in the personal care category , which includes hair ##care , were 15 ##. ##5 per cent last year , above the group margin of 12 ##. ##6 per cent .
unused ##1 In the most recent quarter , Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s sales of health personal care goods rose 7 ##. ##8 per cent to EU ##R ##3 ##. ##6 ##b ##n ( pound ##( ##s ##) ##3 ##b ##n ) , compared with growth of only 3 ##. ##5 per cent for ice ##- ##cre ##am and beverages , and 0 ##. ##5 per cent for sa ##vour ##y foods , dressing ##s and spreads .
unused ##1 A similar dynamic is at work at Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s rival Re ##cki ##tt Ben ##cki ##ser , the maker of C ##ill ##it Bang cleaner and Fin ##ish dish ##wash ##er powder , where health and personal care is growing at 14 per cent a year , compared with 8 per cent growth across the whole business .
unused ##1 The personal care business of Sara Lee , acquired last year , was equally weighted toward developed markets , with most of its sales in western Europe , comprising brands such as Ra ##dox and B ##ryl ##cre ##em .
unused ##1 In the most recent quarter , underlying sales at Un ##ile ##ver in western Europe fell 2 per cent to EU ##R ##1 ##. ##3 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 However , in Asia , Africa and central and eastern Europe , sales rose 8 per cent , to pound ##( ##s ##) ##4 ##. ##7 ##b ##n ##.

unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s first ##- ##qua ##rter sales levels were poor , dropping 1 ##. ##8 per cent , compared to a 1 ##. ##6 per cent decline in the previous quarter .
unused ##1 Under ##lying sales growth of 4 ##. ##8 per cent was stronger than expected as Un ##ile ##ver benefited from price increases pushed through last year .
unused ##1 Western Europe remains a difficult market for Un ##ile ##ver , with sales volumes dropping 3 ##. ##7 per cent in the quarter as consumers switched to cheaper own ##- ##la ##bel products , particularly in ma ##rga ##rine .
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver reports 5 ##. ##5 % sales rise
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver ' ##s success in marketing anti ##- ##dan ##dr ##uff s ##ham ##po ##o to the Russians and Chinese and slim ##ming tea ##s to the French helped the Anglo ##- ##D ##ut ##ch conglomerate report strong full ##- ##ye ##ar sales growth of 5 ##. ##5 per cent yesterday , under ##lining its transformation into a more robust company .
unused ##1 Mar ##gins briefly hit the target in 2004 but have since fallen back to 13 ##. ##7 per cent .
unused ##1 Yet this is hardly a radical departure from the recent past - disposal ##s since 2000 have carved out Euro ##s 8 ##b ##n worth of revenues .
unused ##1 In spite of an improving western European economy , sales there remain s ##lug ##gis ##h .
unused ##1 So while Un ##ile ##ver expects to hit the top end of its 3 ##- ##5 per cent sales growth target this year , it still la ##gs behind peers .
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver sparks strong interest on talk of big divide ##nd
unused ##1 Un ##ile ##ver was in focus yesterday amid talk the consumer goods company could soon announce plans for a large capital return .

unused ##1 He said the European ##bus ##iness , which accounts ##fo ##r some 40 per cent of turnover , was making progress because its rate of decline in underlying sales has slowed from 3 per cent in 2004 to 0 ##. ##5 per cent in the first quarter .

unused ##1 V ##eri ##zon Communications decided to halt the divide ##nds after 2005 because it wanted V ##eri ##zon Wireless to use the cash generated by the business to reduce the mobile operator ' ##s debt , but many analysts saw the controlling shareholder ' ##s move as an attempt to squeeze V ##oda ##fo ##ne out of the joint venture .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s shares closed up 6 ##. ##2 per cent at 115 ##p after the world ' ##s largest mobile phone operator by revenue confirmed it would stick to its operating profit target of pound ##( ##s ##) ##11 ##b ##n to pound ##( ##s ##) ##11 ##. ##5 ##b ##n for 2008 ##- ##0 ##9 , albeit thanks to favourable exchange rate movements .

unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne is expected to say next week that its core profit margin will continue to fall in the current financial year , as the world ' ##s largest mobile phone group by revenue fights fierce competition in its European markets .
unused ##1 Leading industry analysts said V ##oda ##fo ##ne was likely to indicate at its 2006 ##- ##0 ##7 results presentation on Tuesday that the group ' ##s margin would de ##ter ##ior ##ate further in the year to March 31 2008 .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne warned in May last year that its margin on organic adjusted earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation should decline by one percentage point in 2006 ##- ##0 ##7 , continuing a trend that began in 2005 ##- ##0 ##6 .
unused ##1 The de ##ter ##ior ##ating margin position highlighted at V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s half ##- year results in November 2005 put pressure on A ##run Sa ##rin , the group ' ##s chief executive , although his relations with investors have since recovered .

unused ##1 The weak oil price and a down ##grade from RB ##S did the damage .
unused ##1 Moving to a " hold " rating , RB ##S said the lack of commercial success at the Chi ##m C ##ng well in Vietnam and a six month gap in Premier ' ##s drilling schedule would weigh on the share price .

unused ##1 Good news for the UK operator came from a bumper pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##. ##4 ##b ##n divide ##nd from US operator V ##eri ##zon Wireless , in which V ##oda ##fo ##ne owns 45 per cent in a joint venture with V ##eri ##zon Communications .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s management will use the cash to fund a pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##5 ##b ##n share buy ##- ##back programme .
unused ##1 Cash profits at ##tri ##but ##able to V ##oda ##fo ##ne from V ##eri ##zon Wireless rose 14 per cent in the period to pound ##( ##s ##) ##4 ##. ##4 ##9 ##b ##n - which helped adjusted group operating profit rise 2 ##. ##2 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##6 ##. ##2 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 Mobile data revenue climbed 4 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##64 ##b ##n in the second quarter and voice and mess ##aging combined saw revenue s ##lump 14 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##6 ##. ##8 ##7 ##b ##n ##.

unused ##1 On Monday , shares in the UK mobile operator fell 2 per cent after V ##eri ##zon Wireless , its US joint venture with V ##eri ##zon Communications , ruled out regular divide ##nds .
unused ##1 This comes after a 5 per cent jump in July , when the joint venture announced a $ ##10 ##b ##n divide ##nd - its first since 2005 .
unused ##1 It is not a secret that V ##eri ##zon stopped paying divide ##nds in an effort to force V ##oda ##fo ##ne to sell its stake in the successful joint venture to V ##eri ##zon .
unused ##1 But since then V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' ##s trapped cash has been put to good use repay ##ing its debt and V ##oda ##fo ##ne and V ##eri ##zon both have new chiefs , who have bonded better than their predecessors ( they have been bike riding together ) .
unused ##1 On the minus side , underlying service revenues fell 1 ##. ##4 per cent year on year in the second quarter .
unused ##1 But V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s revenue growth also slowed from first ##- ##qua ##rter levels in Germany , partly because of local competition , and there was a 3 ##. ##2 per cent decline in the UK .
unused ##1 Re ##sul ##t : the first quarterly fall in underlying service revenues since 2009 ##- ##10 .
unused ##1 First ##- ##hal ##f earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation , at pound ##( ##s ##) ##6 ##. ##6 ##b ##n , also disappointed , mainly from European weakness , while the e ##bit ##da margin slipped to 30 ##. ##5 per cent , compared with 31 ##. ##2 per cent a year ago ( once restructuring and foreign exchange were excluded ) .
unused ##1 Conversely , there was a better contribution than expected from the US , where 45 per cent ##- ##own ##ed V ##eri ##zon Wireless said on Monday it would pay an $ ##8 ##. ##5 ##b ##n divide ##nd to its two parents .
unused ##1 The amount is slightly less than expected , but that seems to be a trade ##- ##off for an earlier pay ##out , and V ##oda ##fo ##ne will return pound ##( ##s ##) ##1 ##. ##5 ##b ##n to investors via a share buy ##back .
unused ##1 The non ##- ##E ##uro ##pe ##an interests also posted good growth , while net debt remained a reasonable 1 ##. ##8 times e ##bit ##da .
unused ##1 The growth rate of V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s Indian revenue , which accounts for less than a 10th of its total sales , slowed to 13 per cent last year and was less than half that in the final quarter .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s full ##- ##ye ##ar earnings yesterday were like that .
unused ##1 Under ##lying revenues from phone services were down more than 4 per cent year ##- ##on ##- ##ye ##ar in the final three months to March , the weak ##est quarterly result to date .
unused ##1 So , with V ##oda ##fo ##ne looking to take pound ##( ##s ##) ##30 ##0 ##m out of European operating expenses this year and seeing good growth in data usage , executives are projecting a 2013 ##/ ##14 operating profit of pound ##( ##s ##) ##12 ##b ##n ##- ##po ##und ##( ##s ##) ##12 ##. ##8 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 But divide ##nds are pledged to stay at current levels , giving a 5 ##. ##5 per cent yield .
unused ##1 In its first ##- ##qua ##rter results on Friday , the UK ##- ##base ##d mobile operator confirmed the complete di ##cho ##tom ##y it faces in its markets .
unused ##1 Revenue ##s in Turkey increased 32 per cent and India were up by 17 per cent ( although intense competition there limits profit ##ability ) .
unused ##1 On the flip side , the mature European business - which contributes about 70 per cent of revenues - barely grew as it nurse ##d revenue falls of 10 per cent in Spain and 16 per cent in Greece .
unused ##1 A pound ##( ##s ##) ##4 ##b ##n share buy ##- ##back programme now under way will increase that figure to 1 ##. ##8 times - which would remain about 10 per cent below the company ' ##s target .
unused ##1 V ##eri ##zon has long looked to its successful US V ##eri ##zon Wireless business to prop up its declining fixed ##- ##line earnings .
unused ##1 But having spent six years trying to star ##ve out the UK operator by freezing divide ##nd payments , it has now given up .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s chief executive V ##itt ##orio Cola ##o had much pressure on him to return cash to investors , but his decision to return pound ##( ##s ##) ##2 ##b ##n of the divide ##nd to shareholders is not a cave ##- ##in .

unused ##1 The price offered by V ##oda ##fo ##ne is almost twice that of the C ##& ##W ##W share price before its expression of interest , although this had dropped about three ##- ##qua ##rter ##s since dem ##er ##ger from Cable & Wireless Communications , a UK ##- ##listed overseas te ##le ##com ##s business .

unused ##1 E ##ssa ##r , which has an option until May to sell its 33 per cent stake in the venture to V ##oda ##fo ##ne for $ ##5 ##b ##n , or sell a smaller stake at market value , said that the UK group had no power to change its plans to merge E ##ssa ##r ' ##s te ##le ##com ##s business with IS ##L .

unused ##1 In 2007 ##- ##0 ##8 , the business recorded a profit margin of 33 per cent based on earnings before interest , tax , de ##p ##re ##ciation and am ##ort ##isation as a percentage of sales .

unused ##1 Revenue at V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s emerging markets unit rose 9 ##. ##3 per cent on an underlying basis in the third quarter .

unused ##1 Although V ##oda ##fo ##ne said it would use the Pound ##s 1 ##. ##8 ##b ##n to reduce its net debt of Pound ##s 20 ##. ##2 ##b ##n , some analysts predicted the sale proceeds could help finance expansion in emerging markets such as Africa , Asia and eastern Europe .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne has been t ##idy ##ing up its portfolio of businesses in western Europe , where fierce competition and pressure from regulator ##s for price cuts has resulted in slowing revenue growth and declining profit margins .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne raised its outlook for full ##- ##ye ##ar operating profit on the back of a stronger performance than expected in most of its big markets , which out ##wei ##gh ##ed a pound ##( ##s ##) ##45 ##0 ##m charge in its em ##bat ##tled Greek operations .

unused ##1 Pre ##- ##ta ##x profit fell 2 ##. ##8 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##8 ##. ##01 ##b ##n , partly because of higher financing costs and lower investment income after it sold minority stakes in Chinese and Japanese mobile operators .

unused ##1 Sir John said of V ##eri ##zon Wireless at the annual meeting : " The prospect for divide ##nds is now very good , with V ##eri ##zon ' ##s management confirming a pay ##- ##out in 2012 . "
unused ##1 Some investors have become increasingly critical of Mr Sa ##rin since V ##oda ##fo ##ne warned last November of slowing revenue growth and reduced profit margins .
unused ##1 In May it announced a record pre ##- ##ta ##x loss for its 2006 fiscal year of Pound ##s 14 ##. ##9 ##b ##n ##.
unused ##1 But shareholders were alarmed by how V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s European businesses , which contribute more than 70 per cent of group sales , for the first time reported falling underlying revenue in 2008 ##- ##20 ##0 ##9 .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne had been hoping for a re ##sumption of divide ##nds in 2009 after V ##eri ##zon Wireless paid down its debt , but the timetable was pushed back to 2012 by the acquisition of All ##tel , a smaller US mobile operator .
unused ##1 On ##- ##off talks between V ##eri ##zon Communications and V ##oda ##fo ##ne about the future of V ##eri ##zon Wireless may finally be entering an end game , however , because the mobile operator is expected to be debt ##- ##free by the end of next year .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne has been urging its shareholders to be patient , even though some have long been unhappy about the lack of V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' divide ##nds .
unused ##1 V ##eri ##zon Communications paid a divide ##nd worth $ ##5 ##. ##3 ##b ##n in 2009 and Bernstein analysts said that problems at the US group ' ##s fixed ##- ##line phone business meant that it will need to tap V ##eri ##zon Wireless ' cash so as to maintain its shareholder re ##mu ##ner ##ation .

unused ##1 S ##hare ##s in Cable & Wireless Worldwide jumped almost 45 per cent after V ##oda ##fo ##ne confirmed that it was interested in bidding for the troubled te ##le ##com ##s group .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne ' ##s interest surprised the market given the troubled financial position of C ##& ##W Worldwide , which had been struck by three profit warnings in 12 months after the corporate ##- ##fo ##cus ##ed business was dem ##er ##ged from the consumer side of the Cable & Wireless group in March 2010 .
unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne , the world ' ##s biggest mobile phone operator , caused ji ##tters among investors yesterday when it lowered its guidance for margins and revenue growth for the current year amid warnings of in ##tens ##ifying competition .
unused ##1 It expects revenue growth of 6 ##- ##9 per cent , down from " high single digits " , and said margins would be flat or down 1 percentage point from 38 ##. ##5 per cent , rather than its earlier guidance of " broadly stable " margins .
unused ##1 The group has signed up 2 ##. ##1 ##m customers using 3 ##G phones and 300 ##, ##00 ##0 data card users since rolling out the latest generation of mobile technology across 13 markets last November .

unused ##1 V ##oda ##fo ##ne reported revenue of pound ##( ##s ##) ##45 ##. ##9 ##b ##n for the year to March 31 , up 3 ##. ##2 per cent on the previous year , as some of its fast ##- ##gro ##wing businesses in emerging markets offset weakness in southern Europe .
unused ##1 Operating profit excluding one ##- ##off items rose 3 ##. ##1 per cent to pound ##( ##s ##) ##11 ##. ##8 ##b ##n , notably because of a strong performance by V ##eri ##zon Wireless , the US mobile operator in which V ##oda ##fo ##ne has a 45 per cent stake .
